# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in SiSyPHE, contributions to make the library grow are warmly welcome! 

## Examples of contributions

Examples of possible (and ongoing) developments to which you are welcome to contribute include the following. 

* The implementation of new models.

* The implementation of more complex boundary conditions and of models on *non-flat* manifolds. 

* An improved visualization method (currently only basic visualization functions relying on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are implemented). 

## Submitting changes 

If you find a bug or an unexpected behaviour, please open an issue on Github. To add a new feature to the library, please send a pull request with a clear description of what you have done. If you are working on a model which you would like to be included in SiSyPHE, I will be happy to discuss it beforehand either directly on Github or by email first.
