The SiSyPHE library builds on recent advances in hardware and software for the efficient simulation of **large scale interacting particle systems**, both on the **GPU** and on the CPU. The implementation is based on recent libraries originally developed for machine learning purposes to significantly accelerate tensor (array) computations, namely the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) package and the [KeOps](https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/index.html) library. The **versatile object-oriented Python interface** is well suited to the comparison of new and classical many-particle models, enabling ambitious numerical experiments and leading to novel conjectures. The SiSyPHE library speeds up both traditional Python and low-level implementations by **one to three orders of magnitude** for systems with up to **several millions** of particles.

## Installation 

### Requirements

- **Python 3** with packages **NumPy** and **SciPy** 
- **PyTorch** : version>= 1.5
- **PyKeops** : version>= 1.5

### Using pip

In a terminal, type:

```
pip install sisyphe
```
    
### On Google Colab

The easiest way to get a working version of SiSyPHE is to use the free virtual machines provided by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

1. On a new Colab notebook, navigate to Editâ†’Notebook Settings and select GPU from the Hardware Accelerator drop-down.

2. Install PyKeops with the Colab specifications **first** by typing

```    
!pip install pykeops[colab]
```

3. Install SiSyPHE by typing 

```
!pip install sisyphe
```    

### Testing the installation

In a Python terminal, type 

```python
import sisyphe
sisyphe.test_sisyphe()
```

## Contributing

Contributions to make SiSyPHE grow are warmly welcome! Examples of possible (and ongoing) developments include the following. 

* The implementation of new models.

* The implementation of more complex boundary conditions and of models on *non-flat* manifolds. 

* An improved visualization method (currently only basic visualization functions relying on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are implemented). 

Contributions can be made by opening an issue on the GitHub repository, via a pull request or by contacting directly the author.
