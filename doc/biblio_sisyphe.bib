In this paper, a kinetic (mean-field) version of the CVA model is proposed and its formal macroscopic limit is provided. The final macroscopic model involves a conservation equation for the density of the individuals and a non-conservative equation for the director of the mean velocity and is proved to be hyperbolic. The derivation is based on the introduction of a non-conventional concept of a collisional invariant of a collision operator.},

@article{dimarco_self-alignment_2016,
	abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in studying self-alignment mechanisms described as jump processes. In the dynamics proposed, active particles are moving at a constant speed and align with their neighbors at random times following a Poisson process. This dynamics can be viewed as an asynchronous version of the so-called Vicsek model. Starting from this particle dynamics, we introduce the related kinetic description and then derive a continuum hydrodynamic model. We then introduce different discretization strategies for the hierarchy of proposed models, we numerically study the convergence of the schemes and compare the behaviors of the different systems for several test cases.},

@article{degond_nematic_2020,
	abstract = {Starting from a particle model describing self-propelled particles interacting through nematic alignment, we derive a macroscopic model for the particle density and mean direction of motion. We first propose a mean-field kinetic model of the particle dynamics. After diffusive rescaling of the kinetic equation, we formally show that the distribution function converges to an equilibrium distribution in particle direction, whose local density and mean direction satisfies a cross-diffusion system. We show that the system is consistent with symmetries typical of a nematic material. The derivation is carried over by means of a Hilbert expansion. It requires the inversion of the linearized collision operator for which we show that the generalized collision invariants, a concept introduced to overcome the lack of momentum conservation of the system, plays a central role. This cross-diffusion system poses many new challenging questions.},

We recall the formulation and analytical results of the original model, then we discuss variants using component-wise independent or common noise. In combination with mini-batch approaches those variants were tailored for machine learning applications. Moreover, it turns out that the analytical estimates are dimension independent, which is useful for high-dimensional problems. We discuss the relationship of consensus-based optimization with particle swarm optimization, a method widely used in the engineering community. Then we survey a variant of consensus-based optimization that is proposed for global optimization problems constrained to hyper-surfaces.

@article{de_bortoli_quantitative_2020,
	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the limiting behavior of a continuous-time counterpart of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm applied to two-layer overparameterized neural networks, as the number or neurons (ie, the size of the hidden layer) \$N {\textbackslash}to +{\textbackslash}infty\$. Following a probabilistic approach, we show 'propagation of chaos' for the particle system defined by this continuous-time dynamics under different scenarios, indicating that the statistical interaction between the particles asymptotically vanishes. In particular, we establish quantitative convergence with respect to \$N\$ of any particle to a solution of a mean-field McKean-Vlasov equation in the metric space endowed with the Wasserstein distance. In comparison to previous works on the subject, we consider settings in which the sequence of stepsizes in SGD can potentially depend on the number of neurons and the iterations. We then identify two regimes under which different mean-field limits are obtained, one of them corresponding to an implicitly regularized version of the minimization problem at hand. We perform various experiments on real datasets to validate our theoretical results, assessing the existence of these two regimes on classification problems and illustrating our convergence results.},

@article{rotskoff_trainability_2019,
	abstract = {Neural networks, a central tool in machine learning, have demonstrated remarkable, high fidelity performance on image recognition and classification tasks. These successes evince an ability to accurately represent high dimensional functions, but rigorous results about the approximation error of neural networks after training are few. Here we establish conditions for global convergence of the standard optimization algorithm used in machine learning applications, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and quantify the scaling of its error with the size of the network. This is done by reinterpreting SGD as the evolution of a particle system with interactions governed by a potential related to the objective or "loss" function used to train the network. We show that, when the number \$n\$ of units is large, the empirical distribution of the particles descends on a convex landscape towards the global minimum at a rate independent of \$n\$, with a resulting approximation error that universally scales as \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$. These properties are established in the form of a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the empirical distribution. Our analysis also quantifies the scale and nature of the noise introduced by SGD and provides guidelines for the step size and batch size to use when training a neural network. We illustrate our findings on examples in which we train neural networks to learn the energy function of the continuous 3-spin model on the sphere. The approximation error scales as our analysis predicts in as high a dimension as \$d=25\$.},

The disadvantage of memory effects induced by the need to store the local best position is overcome by the introduction of an additional differential equation describing the evolution of the local best. A regularization process for the global best permits to formally derive the respective mean-field description. Subsequently, in the small inertia limit, we compute the related macroscopic hydrodynamic equations that clarify the link with the recently introduced consensus based optimization (CBO) methods. Several numerical examples illustrate the mean field process, the small inertia limit and the potential of this general class of global optimization methods.},

@article{mei_mean_2018,
	abstract = {Multilayer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires optimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem that is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the former case, does this happen because local minima are absent or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the latter, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper, we consider a simple case, namely two-layer neural networks, and prove that---in a suitable scaling limit---SGD dynamics is captured by a certain nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows for ``averaging out'' some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of topological states in a new collective dynamics model. This individual-based model (IBM) describes self-propelled rigid bodies moving with constant speed and adjusting their rigid-body attitude to that of their neighbors. In previous works, a macroscopic model has been derived from this IBM in a suitable scaling limit. In the present work, we exhibit explicit solutions of the macroscopic model characterized by a non-trivial topology. We show that these solutions are well approximated by the IBM during a certain time but then the IBM transitions towards topologically trivial states. Using a set of appropriately defined topological indicators, we reveal that the breakage of the non-trivial topology requires the system to go through a phase of maximal disorder. We also show that similar but topologically trivial initial conditions result in markedly different dynamics, suggesting that topology plays a key role in the dynamics of this system.},

These methods use small but random batches for particle interactions, thus the computational cost is reduced from \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ per time step to \$O(N)\$, for a system with \$N\$ particles with binary interactions. On one hand, these methods are efficient Asymptotic-Preserving schemes for the underlying particle systems, allowing \$N\$-independent time steps and also capture, in the \$N {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$ limit, the solution of the mean field limit which are nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations; on the other hand, the stochastic processes generated by the algorithms can also be regarded as new models for the underlying problems. For one of the methods, we give a particle number independent error estimate under some special interactions. Then, we apply these methods to some representative problems in mathematics, physics, social and data sciences, including the Dyson Brownian motion from random matrix theory, Thomson's problem, distribution of wealth, opinion dynamics and clustering. Numerical results show that the methods can capture both the transient solutions and the global equilibrium in these problems.},
